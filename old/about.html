<p>CarolinaJourneys.com is an online journal dedicated to exploring the less-explored aspects of North and South Carolina's geography, history, folklore, and culture. We publish accounts, portrayals, and descriptions of the paths people have taken through the Carolinas as they have pursued their conscious, unconscious, obscure, or famous goals. As you will see, these trails, both real and imagined, cover a lot of ground.

<p><a href="images/editor.jpg" border=0><img src="images/editorsm.jpg" align="left"></a>The founding editor of CarolinaJourneys was Tom Fowler. In addition to editing the CarolinaJourneys website, Fowler was an unpublished poet and a truculent, disaffected tourist. He had read his dog-eared copy of the <i>WPA Guide to North Carolina</i> cover-to-cover several times. He held down a day job in Raleigh working for the man, and graciously shared his living space with two bored cats, two former Pokemon enthusiasts, and one skeptical adult of his own generation. Tom died unexpectedly May 21, 2004 at the too-early age of 49, but he lives on in our hearts and minds and in his stories.

Fowler is partial to books, but is nevertheless passionate about the internet and the future of electronic publishing. Contact her if you will, but do so electronically and spare those trees.
