# Welcome to Carolina Journeys

*Exploring the trails of the Carolinas, both real and imagined*

Carolina Journeys is where history meets adventure, where ancient Cherokee trading paths intersect with modern hiking trails, and where the stories of the past come alive through personal exploration.

I'm Grant Fowler, and I believe that the best way to understand history is to walk in the footsteps of those who came before us. Whether I'm following a documented trail from colonial times or piecing together the likely route of a long-lost trading path, each journey becomes a story that bridges past and present.

## What You'll Find Here

**Historical Expeditions**: Deep dives into the forgotten places and pathways of Carolina history, from Cherokee villages to colonial settlements.

**Trail Adventures**: Real-time accounts of hiking, exploring, and discovering the landscapes that shaped our region's story.

**Maps & Mysteries**: Investigations into historical maps, lost settlements, and the sometimes-blurry line between documented history and local legend.

**Personal Memoirs**: Reflections on what it means to be a modern explorer in an ancient landscape.

## The Journey Continues

Every trail has a story. Every story has a trail. Join me as we explore both the real and imagined paths that wind through the heart of the Carolinas.

*Happy trails,*  
Grant
