Welcome to Carolina Journeys, where we explore the trails of the Carolinas—both real and imagined.

This blog is born from a simple belief: the best way to understand history is to walk where it happened. Whether following a documented Cherokee trading path or piecing together the route of a forgotten colonial road, each journey becomes a bridge between past and present.

## What Makes This Different

This isn't just a hiking blog, and it's not just a history blog. It's something in between—a place where:

- **Historical research meets boots-on-the-ground exploration**
- **Ancient maps guide modern adventures**  
- **Personal discovery illuminates broader stories**
- **The line between documented fact and local legend gets delightfully blurry**

## What's Coming

In the weeks ahead, we'll be exploring:

- The lost Cherokee settlements of the Blue Ridge foothills
- Colonial-era trading paths that connected the coast to the mountains  
- Forgotten Civil War sites hidden in Carolina forests
- The stories maps tell when you know how to read them

Each post will combine historical context with personal exploration, offering both the "what happened here" and the "what it's like to visit today."

## Join the Journey

Whether you're a fellow history enthusiast, an avid hiker, or someone who simply loves a good story, I invite you to join me on these Carolina journeys.

After all, every trail has a story. Every story has a trail.

*Happy trails,*  
Grant
